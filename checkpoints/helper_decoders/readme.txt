In this folder are stored the checkpoints of the helper decoders, needed for the computation of pseudo-labels.
The name of the files is as follow:

P*.*.*_E*_C*-*

P is for "(hyper)Parameters" and the following 3 integers specify the indices of hyperparamters used.
E is for "Encoder", followed by the number of classes of the encoder.
C is for "Classes", followed by the range of classes the decoder is in charge of.
